C projects (some are from C only &amp; some are from different libraries & packages & modules).
Feel free to contribute & optimise in these projects, I will be really glad.

To run C program we need to create a.out file which can be executed anytime without running the main program again and again
```
g++ file_name.c
```
Or 
```
clang file_name.c
```
Now once the a.out file is created will type
```
./a.out
```
